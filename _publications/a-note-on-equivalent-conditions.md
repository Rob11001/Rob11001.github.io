In this paper, we introduced novel characterizations of the classical concept of majorization
in terms of upper triangular (resp., lower triangular) row-stochastic matrices, and in terms of sequences
of linear transforms on vectors. We use our new characterizations of majorization to derive an improved
entropy inequality.
