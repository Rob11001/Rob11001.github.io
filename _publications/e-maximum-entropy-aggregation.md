Given a random variable \(X\) that takes values in a finite set 
\(\mathcal{X} = \{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}\), and a positive number \(R\), 
we consider the  problem of finding a  deterministic function \(f: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}\) 
 that maximizes the entropy \(H(f(X))\), 
while satisfying the constraint \(H(f(X)) \leq R\). 
 {This problem occurs in several contexts,}
including lossy compression with logarithmic
loss and the well-known  {Deterministic} Information Bottleneck problem.
We prove the NP-hardness of finding the optimal solution  {to the above} maximization problem. On the positive side, 
we design approximation algorithms that achieve improved approximation factors compared to existing methods in the literature.
