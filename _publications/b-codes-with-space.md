We consider the problem of constructing prefix-free codes in which a designated symbol, a space, can only appear at the end of codewords. We provide a linear-time algorithm to construct almost-optimal codes with this property, meaning that their average length differs from the minimum possible by at most one. We obtain our results by uncovering a relation between our class of codes and the class of one-to-one codes. Additionally, we derive upper and lower bounds to the average length of optimal prefix-free codes with a space in terms of the source entropy.
