Dimension reduction is a technique used to transform data from a high-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional space, aiming to retain as much of the original information as possible. This approach is crucial in many disciplines like engineering, biology, astronomy, and economics. In this paper, we consider the following dimensionality reduction instance: Given an n-dimensional probability distribution p and an integer ùëö<ùëõ, we aim to find the m-dimensional probability distribution q that is the closest to p, using the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence as the measure of closeness. We prove that the problem is strongly NP-hard, and we present an approximation algorithm for it.
