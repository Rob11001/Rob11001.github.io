In this paper, we consider the problem of constructing optimal average-length binary 
codes
under the constraint that each codeword must contain at most `D` ones, where $D$ is 
a given input 
parameter.
We provide an `O(n^2D)`-time complexity algorithm for the construction of such codes, where `n` is the number of codewords. We also describe several scenarios where the need to design  
these kinds of codes naturally arises. Our algorithms allow us to construct both optimal
average-length prefix binary codes and optimal
average-length alphabetic binary codes. In the former case, our `O(n^2D)`-time algorithm
substantially improves on the previously known `O(n^{2+D})`-time complexity algorithm for the
same problem.
We also provide a Kraft-like inequality for the existence of (optimal) variable-length binary codes, subject to the above-described constraint on the number of 1's in each codeword.
